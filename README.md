This project aims to analyze the difference in performance between gRPC and REST.
The gRPC-server is realized based on the lab content and run in Docker.
The REST-server is rebuilt from the first lab using FastAPI as Flask have heavy overhead, also run in Docker.
some contents in protobuf, gRPC-server are different compared to lab guideline during the implementation.
gRPC source files is compiled locally.
there are 2 clients, one is to test the gRPC-server, one is for the performance test.
